This is my very first personal project making an iOS app, created two at the end of my second week of coding.

Early on in the Udemy course I was taught the basics of Swift and Xcode and in the progress I was guided in the creation of an app that rolls two dice.
Expanding on this idea I then created this app to roll different types of dice, taking inspiration from the fantasy tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons.

Later on, using some newly gained coding skills, I have significantly simplified the app by reducing the numbers of View Controllers and screens
from 7 to only 2 whilst retaining all of the app functionalities.

Skills acquired and implemented:

- Creation of multi page app using segues
- UI Alert messages
- if/else statements
- Struct and functions with return value
- MVC design pattern
- Passing data between View Controllers
- Incorporation of vibration and audio feedback
