# DnD_app
Final DnD app project

This is my very first personal project making an iOS app.
Early on in the Udemy course I was taught the basics of Swift and Xcode and in the progress I was guided in the creation of an app that rolls two dice.
Expanding on this idea I then created this app to roll different types of dice.

Later on, using some newly gained coding skills, I have significantly simplified the app by reducing the numbers of View Controllers and screens
from 7 to only 2 whilst retaining all of the app functionalities.

Skills acquired and implemented:

1) Creation of multi page app using segues
2) UI Alert messages
3) if/else statements
4) Struct and functions with output
5) MVC design pattern
6) Passing data between View Controllers
7) Implementation of vibration and audio files within the app
